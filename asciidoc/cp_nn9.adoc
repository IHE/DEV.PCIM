2+^|*Device-Patient Association Query Capabilities*

|Submitterâ€™s Name(s) and e-mail address(es):
|Eldon Metz, emetz@innovisionmedical.com

|Submission Date:
|TBD

|Integration Profile(s) affected:
|Point-of-Care Identity Management (PCIM)

|Actor(s) affected:
|Device-Patient Association Consumer +
Device-Patient Association Manager 

|IHE Technical Framework or Supplement modified:
|PCIM Profile TI revision 2.1, dated 2024-07-01

|Volume(s) and Section(s) affected:
|Trial Implementation, Multiple Sections

2+|Rationale for Change:

Earlier versions of the PCIM trial implementation specification included use-cases that provided the ability to perform current and retrospective queries of device patient associations. The approach was based on HL7v2 query messaging. During WG sessions it was decided that the query capabilities are better matched to FHIR.

This Change Proposal (CP) proposes changes to the specification to include FHIR query support for querying Device-Patient associations.
