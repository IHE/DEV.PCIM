2+|Rationale for Change:

After PCIM connectathon testing in 2025, it was noted that OBX-1 for DEV-51 (Communicate Association State) and DEV-52 (Report Association State) transactions was set to be optional. This was inconsistent with PCD TF-2. During review, it was also noted that the description for OBX-4 needed to be clarified and made more consistent with expectations of containment with the TF. It was agreed on in the PCIM WG to change the optionality to required and to fix the value for OBX-4 to 0.0.0.0.

This Change Proposal (CP) proposes changes to PCIM TI to implement the profile clarifications and positions for the above issue.
