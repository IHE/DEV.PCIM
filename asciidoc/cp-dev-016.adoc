2+|Rationale for Change:

After PCIM connectathon testing in 2025, it was noted that OBX-1 for DEV-51 (Communicate Association State) and DEV-52 (Report Association State) transactions was set to be optional. This was inconsistent with PCD TF-2. It was agreed on in the PCIM WG to change the optionality to required.

This Change Proposal (CP) proposes changes to PCIM TI to implement the profile clarifications and positions for the above issue.
