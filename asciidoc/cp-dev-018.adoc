2+^|*Clarifying requirements and semantics for DEV-51 and DEV-52 for corrected, deleted and wrong message indicator*

|Submission Date:
| TBD

|Integration Profile(s) affected:
|Point-of-Care Identity Management (PCIM)

|Actor(s) affected:
|Device-Patient Association Consumer +

|IHE Technical Framework or Supplement modified:
|PCIM Profile TI (PCIM TI) revision 2.2, dated 2024-12-05

|Volume(s) and Section(s) affected:
|PCIM TI, Sections A.1.2.4, A.1.2.5 and A.1.2.6

2+|Rationale for Change:

While anticipating production deployment and during analsysis of edge cases, it was noted that it was unclear what OBR-7/8 should be for deleted, corrected and wrong scenarios in DEV-51 (Communicate Association State) and DEV-52 (Report Association State) transactions. While reviewing this, PRT-11/12 interpretations were also identified to be clarified and/or updated. It was also noted that it was necessary to support corrections for patient identity changes for merges, unmerges, id changes and contact moves. It was agreed on in the PCIM WG to clarify the requirements around interpretation of these fields in a CP.

This Change Proposal (CP) proposes changes to PCIM TI to implement the profile clarifications and positions for the above issue.

| *Participation Status* | *AUT* | *EQUIP* | *RO*

| R-Asserted
| Time that the person/device asserted the association between the patient and device.

Time that the person in this role observed the person/device in the AUT role asserting the association.

| F-Validated
