2+^|*OBR-7/8 and PRT-11/12 semantics for DEV-51 and DEV-52 for corrected, deleted and wrong*

|IHE Technical Framework or Supplement modified:
|PCIM Profile TI (PCIM TI) revision 2.2, dated 2024-12-05

|Volume(s) and Section(s) affected:
|PCIM TI, Sections A.1.2.4 and A.1.2.6

2+|Rationale for Change:

While anticipating production deployment and during analsysis of edge cases, it was noted that it was unclear what OBR-7/8 should be for deleted, corrected and wrong scenarios in DEV-51 (Communicate Association State) and DEV-52 (Report Association State) transactions. While reviewing this, PRT-11/12 interpretations wwere also identified to be clarified and/or updated. It was agreed on in the PCIM WG to clarify the requirements around interpretation of these fields in a CP.

This Change Proposal (CP) proposes changes to PCIM TI to implement the profile clarifications and positions for the above issue.

| _Section A.1.2.4 in PCIM TI - OBR - Observation Request_, update the text to clarify population of OBR-7/8 on deleted, corrected and wrong scenarios:

The OBR shall also include the timestamp of the earliest participant involvement (OBR-7) and latest participant involvement (OBR-8) for an association or disassociation event report. Each report consists of two Participation Information Segments (PRT) and each may have timestamps for their involvement in PRT-11 and/or PRT-12. OBR-7 and OBR-8 conveys the range of time of both participants. See Table A.1.2.6-3 and Table A.1.2.6-4 for definitions of the timestamp semantics in PRT-11 and PRT-12. The logic for filling in the timestamp values for OBR-7 and OBR-8 is to examine both the PRT segments that will be sent out in the report and set OBR-7 to the earliest timestamp value and OBR-8 to the latest timestamp value. OBR-7 and 8 may contain the same timestamp.
