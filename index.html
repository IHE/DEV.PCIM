            <p><strong>Foreword</strong></p>
            <p>This is a supplement to the IHE Devices Domain Technical
            Framework. Each supplement undergoes a process of public
            comment and trial implementation before being incorporated
            into the volumes of the Technical Frameworks.</p>
            <p>This supplement is published on xx,xx 7, 2023 for trial
            implementation and may be available for testing at
            subsequent IHE Connectathons. The supplement may be amended
            based on the results of testing. Following successful
            testing it will be incorporated into the Patient Care Device
            Technical Framework. Comments are invited and can be
            submitted at <a
            href="http://www.ihe.net/PCD_Public_Comments/"><a

            <p>This supplement describes changes to the existing
            technical framework documents.</p>
            <p>“Boxed” instructions like the sample below indicate to
            the Volume Editor how to integrate the relevant section(s)
            into the relevant Technical Framework volume.</p>
            <p>Amend Section X.X by the following:</p>
            <p>Where the amendment adds text, make the added text
            <strong><u>bold underline</u></strong>. Where the amendment
            removes text, make the removed text <strong><del>bold
            strikethrough</del></strong>. When entire new sections are
            added, introduce with editor’s instructions to “add new
            text” or similar, which for readability are not bolded or
            underlined.</p>

            this Supplement</h1>
            <p>This supplement to the IHE Patient Care Device Technical
            Frameworks adds the rationale and implementation details of
            the Point-of-Care Identity Management Profile to the
            Framework, providing a means for standards-based exchange
            between systems of information collected and confirmed at
            the point of care tracking the set of medical devices
            originating observations about each patient.</p>
            <h2 id="open-issues-and-questions">Open Issues and
            Questions</h2>
            <p>The work group solicits feedback on workflow effects and
            problems found in analyzing the profile and in trial
            implementation.</p>
            <h2 id="closed-issues">Closed Issues</h2>
            <p>Discuss differences from previous approaches based on ADT
            messages: will be faster, closer to the actual events than
            ADT feeds, which have a different purpose and are often not
            well synchronized with actual events at the point-of-care.
            Will enable devices, device controllers and a variety of
            other hospital systems to flexibly exchange information,
            publish or subscribe to change notifications.</p>

            <h4 id="7111-device-patient-association-reporter">7.1.1.1
            Device-Patient Association Reporter</h4>
            <p>The Device-Patient Association Reporter represents a
            system or person that is asserts that a given device is
            attached or removed from a specific patient. For each such
            event, the unique Patient ID, Device ID, and timestamp must
            be reported.</p>
            <h4 id="7112-device-patient-association-manager">7.1.1.2
            Device-Patient Association Manager</h4>
            <p>The Device-Patient Association Manager represents a
            system that collects and persists information on what
            devices are or were connected to which patients within a
            defined scope, such as a clinical unit, at a given time, and
            can communicate these associations as query responses, event
            notifications, or both.</p>
            <h4 id="7113-device-patient-association-consumer">7.1.1.3
            Device-Patient Association Consumer</h4>
            <p>The Device-Patient Association Consumer represents a
            system or person that is has a requirement to receive
            information on what devices are or were connected to which
            patients. A common example is a critical care system that
            charts device observations for a patient.</p>
            <h4 id="7114-device-registrant">7.1.1.4 Device
            Registrant</h4>
            <p>The Device Registrant represents a system or person that
            maintains the list of medical devices that can be connected
            to a patient. The list entry for each device typically
            includes the device type, location (may not apply if the
            device is mobile), and unique identity.</p>
            <p>The Device Registrant announces when a device is placed
            in or taken out of service, is relocated, and other events
            as required.</p>
            <p>Where this is a person, it is most likely hospital staff
            that is interacting directly with the Device-Patient
            Association Manager through its user interface.</p>
            <p>Where it is a system, it may be a comprehensive device
            inventory system, a “gateway” system, or even the device
            itself.</p>
            <h2 id="72-pcim-actor-options">7.2 PCIM Actor Options</h2>
            <p>The Device-Patient Association Consumer has two options
            available for receiving data from the Device-Patient
            Association Manager. The first option is to query the
            Manager for a snapshot of current associations, either by
            sending a patient identifier and receiving back the
            associated device(s) or by sending a device identifier and
            receiving back the associated patient. The second option is
            to receive an unsolicited continuous stream of association
            and disassociation events from the Manager as they occur.
            The Device-Patient Association Manager should support
            sending data via both methods, and the Device-Patient
            Association Consumer may support one or both methods.</p>
            <p>Options that may be selected for each actor in this
            profile, if any, are listed in the Table 7.2-1. Dependencies
            between options, when applicable, are specified in

            <h3 id="741-concepts">7.4.1 Concepts</h3>
            <p>Properly validated associations between devices, and
            patients that the devices are sourcing observations for, are
            an essential underpinning for clinical surveillance and
            clinical decision support systems. Patient safety depends on
            certainty that the values being charted do not have gaps, or
            worse, data from the wrong patient.</p>
            <p>This profile provides standards-based messages for
            communications about the beginning, end, and current state
            of intervals in which a device is associated with a
            particular patient. It uses HL7 version 2 messages, still
            the most common pattern in healthcare institutions for
            similar information such as patient demographics. It does
            not specify a particular configuration of systems for its
            functions, but rather describes roles which may be assigned
            to different systems according to the workflow in the
            institution. For example, selection of the patient and the
            devices could be accomplished on a module of an electronic
            medical record system, on a medical device such as a
            physiological monitor or ventilator with appropriate
            communication and display capabilities, or on a hand carried
            device controlling another healthcare information
            system.</p>

            Use Case #1 Associating Device with Patient: Process
            Flow</h5>
            <p>This use case can be driven by an authorized user
            responsible for entering, verifying, or both, the beginning
            and ending of an association between a device and a
            particular patient. The should be based on first person
            awareness of the situation at the point of care. Automatic
            Identification and Data Capture methods such as barcodes or
            RFID should be used to assist the workflow and increase data
            reliability to the maximum feasible extent. In certain
            circumstances and with appropriate risk analysis, the
            association may be automatically generated. For example, a
            device with its own “admission” process, the act of
            manipulating the user interface at the point of care to
            “admit” a patient to the device may be deemed a patient-safe
            way of generating validated information of this
            device-patient association. For another example, a device
            with a fixed location and a known patient associated with
            the location may be appropriate to originate a
            device-patient association.</p>
            <p>These means of identification are specific to the
            clinical environment in question, and standard procedures of

            <h5 id="74221-description">7.4.2.2.1 Description</h5>
            <p>At the time the device is no longer set up to make
            observations on the patient, the Device-Patient Association
            Reporter originates a message conveying this information to
            the Device-Patient Association Manager. It should be noted
            that even though this may be a less salient event at the
            point of care, completeness and accuracy of disassociation
            is as important to an accurate record and proper association
            of observations with patients. This is a key issue in risk
            analysis and in system design.</p>
            <h5 id="74222-process-flow">7.4.2.2.2 Process Flow</h5>
            <p>The Device-Patient Association Manager receives the
            information that the association between a particular
            patient and one or more devices no longer exists. An
            authorized operator may originate this message through a
            user interface. In some cases, the device itself is capable
            of determining that the association has been broken and can
            communicate this information directly to the Device-Patient
            Association Manager, or indirectly through the
            Device-Patient Association Reporter. It may be appropriate
            to note this event on a user interface and get confirmation
            that it is correct. It also could be appropriate to ask
            whether other devices on record as being connected to the
            same patient are still connected or not.</p>

            when the logical connection between a device and the data it
            originates and a particular patient is established, after

            <h5 id="317412-message-semantics">3.17.4.1.2 Message
            Semantics</h5>
            <p>The significant content of the message is the
            following:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Confirmed unique identity of patient, preferably
            derived from an AIDC (Automatic Identification and Data
            Capture) such as scanning the patient wristband or reading
            an RFID tag. Code used to identify the patient must be
            chosen so as to be unique at least over the scope of the set
            of patients seen over all information systems in the
            institution, such as a Medical Record Number issued by the
            institution for the patient, or, if available, a national id
            number. The type and issuing entity shall be recorded with
            the code. Additional identity codes may be provided at the
            discretion of the institution. Note that any code
            identifiable with an individual patient must by secured from
            misuse in accordance with applicable legal and policy
            procedures.</p></li>
            <li><p>Unique identity of Device. This again is determined
            by site considerations. It is preferable to use a
            universally unique identification of the individual instance
            of the device, such as an IEEE EUI-64 or a Unique Device
            Identifier such as one produced in accordance with the US
            FDA (or other regulatory agency) UDI standards. If this is
            not possible, then another universal identification scheme
            such as EUI-64 or a local identification scheme allowing all
            device instances in the institution to be uniquely
            distinguished and tracked may be used. Additional
            identification codes may be included. Whatever code is used
            should be possible to record automatically, as manual data
            entry has a high error rate, and correct identification is a
            patient safety concern.</p></li>
            <li><p>Identity of the authorized person responsible for
            obtaining and visually confirming the identity information
            for the patient and the device.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The form of the message is similar to an unsolicited
            observation report, with supplementary PRT segments
            identifying the device, human operator originating the
            association. See Appendix 0 for details of HL7 V2
            messages.</p>
            <p>On receipt of the message, the manager system checks for
            valid syntax and that the:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><p>originating Reporter system and human user are
            authorized for their roles</p></li>
            <li><p>the device is a member of the set of registered
            device instances and has no current conflicting association
            recorded (e.g., a single-patient device has an active
            association with a different patient)</p></li>
            <li><p>the patient identity provided corresponds to a known
            person in an appropriate status (e.g., admitted)</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>After these checks, the Manager logs the result and
            returns an appropriate positive or negative acknowledgement
            to the Reporter. The system design must assure that errors
            are indicated to the appropriate human user(s) in an
            effective and timely manner so that action can be taken.</p>
            <p>If the checks are passed, the Manager establishes a
            record of the existence of the association and its effective
            time.</p>

            Device-Patient Association Query</h4>
            <p>This message from a Device-Patient Association Consumer
            requests a response from a Device-Patient Association
            Manager containing device-patient association data. A
            Device-Patient Association Manager is expected to be able to
            service multiple Device-Patient Association Consumer systems
            and manage different query and response streams and
            communications connections with each. Whether these
            communications ports are preconfigured, or dynamic with
            appropriate node identification and authorization for each
            connection request, is a matter of implementation
            design.</p>
            <p>There are multiple use cases:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>A request for a ‘current snapshot’ of associations
            filtered as specified by the query parameters.</li>
            </ol>
            <!-- -->

            <ol start="4" type="1">
            <li><p>A request for an ongoing real-time feed of changes in
            associations.</p></li>
            <li><p>Possibly less important would be request for a
            ‘replay’ of data from a specified time period in the
            past.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Trying to fit these cases with the array of patterns
            present in Chapter 5 (Queries) of the HL7 Specification
            presents some puzzles. This profile chooses the QSB
            publish-subscribe paradigm, matching option 1, as the
            general case and treats 2 and 3 as special cases of it using
            some special semantics of query parameters described
            below.</p>
            <h5 id="319411-trigger-events">3.19.4.1.1 Trigger
            Events</h5>
            <p>This message is triggered by the Device-Patient
            Association Consumer when it requires information about a
            device or devices associated with a patient currently or in
            the past (within the period available from the
            Device-Patient Association Manager). It may also be used to
            request a continuing feed of data concerning changes in
            device-patient associations within the scope of the
            Device-Patient Association Manager.</p>
            <h5 id="319412-message-semantics">3.19.4.1.2 Message
            Semantics</h5>
            <p>This message is a query specification. It gives the scope
            of the information wanted by the Device-Patient Association
            Consumer in response to the query: what patients, units,
            devices and time periods are pertinent. See Appendix 0 for
            details of HL7 segment contents and semantics.</p>
            <h5 id="319413-expected-actions">3.19.4.1.3 Expected
            Actions</h5>
            <p>The Device-Patient Association Manager is responsible for
            collecting, formatting and sending the requested information
            back to the querying Device-Patient Association Consumer
            according to the filtering specified in the query.</p>
            <p>The management of the query and response connection
            between the Device-Patient Association Consumer and the
            Device-Patient Association Manager in the case of an ongoing
            subscription is an implementation detail, but one practical
            method is for the Device-Patient Association Manager to
            maintain an open TCP listen port to accepts connections from
            one or more Device-Patient Association Consumer clients and
            then to open an individual TCP connection with each
            requester that persists as long as the client is connected
            and the query is valid (within its time limits, if any). For
            a non-subscription, “snapshot”-type query, the
            Device-Patient Association Manager could just respond on the
            static connection that the query comes in on.</p>
            <h4
            id="31942-device-patient-association-query-response">3.19.4.2
            Device-Patient Association Query Response</h4>
            <p>The response carries the requested data if the
            Device-Patient Association Manager has any matching the
            specification. If there is none available, the response is
            in effect an empty frame with zero data records in the
            position that data would be expected. If the request is
            ill-formed (incorrect syntax or impossible query
            specification), an indication of the nature of the error
            should be returned.</p>
            <h5 id="319421-trigger-events">3.19.4.2.1 Trigger
            Events</h5>
            <p>This message and the activity of preparing it, is
            triggered in the Device-Patient Association Manager by the
            query request from the Device-Patient Association Consumer.
            This trigger may request a snapshot of current state
            (Snapshot Option), or request the setting up of a sequence
            of messages triggered by a state change in the
            device-patient associations (Subscription Option).</p>
            <h5 id="319422-message-semantics">3.19.4.2.2 Message
            Semantics</h5>
            <p>The message is made up of a frame identifying the
            message, a read-back of the query parameters of the request,
            and the requested data represented as a set of observations
            portraying the pertinent device-patient association
            states.</p>
            <p>This response may be part of a sequence of messages sent
            when device-patient association state transitions happen
            within the scope of the request from the Device-Patient
            Association Consumer that initiated. For detailed semantics
            and the construction of the HL7 message structure and
            segment contents, see Appendix A.2.3.</p>
            <h5 id="319423-expected-actions">3.19.4.2.3 Expected
            Actions</h5>
            <p>The Device-Patient Association Consumer is expected to
            take actions depending on the reason it made the query
            request and its own business logic. An example would be for
            a device without its own selection and validation mechanism
            for identifying the patient it is interacting with to
            receive and use the information from the Device-Patient
            Association Manager to send that patient identity
            information with its observations or display the patient
            identity on its user interface.</p>

            considered observations (it was observed that device
            <em>d1</em> was connected to patient p1 starting at
            <em>t1</em> and ending at <em>t2</em>), the ORU message
            structure is used throughout this profile to manage

            Device-Patient Disassociation – the only difference between

            patient who is associated to the device. The Patient
            Identifier List must contain an identifier that is unique
            for all patients within the scope of the system. By default,
            if an identifier on the list is identified as a medical
            record number, it is used (PID-3.5 Identifier Type code
            valued as “MR”). There may be multiple identifiers in the
            list, and implementers may choose to allow a different
            identifier than the medical record number to be used as a
            configuration option.</p>

            <p>PRT-10 should contain some form of identifier sufficient
            to uniquely identify the device within the scope of the
            overall system. This is a repeating field, so more than one
            identifier can be given. If available, it should have as one
            of its values the “human readable form” of the Unique Device
            Identifier defined by the US FDA, where applicable, but in
            any case must contain See details in the UDI Final Rule
            (U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2013).</p>
            <p>It should be noted that the use of OBX-18 for equipment
            identification has been deprecated. So for long-term use,
            the PRT segment is preferred. See PCD TF-2 Appendix B.10.2

            participating. This may reflect an unstructured or a

            identifiers, or bar codes.</p>
            <p>If this attribute repeats, all instances must represent
            the same device.</p>
            <p><strong>Condition</strong>: At least one of the

            Participation Location, or Participation Device fields must

            <p>The identifier root shall be the OID assigned to UDI. For
            example, for FDA UDIs the root shall be
            2.16.840.1.113883.3.3719, and the extension shall be the
            Human Readable Form appropriate for the style of content.
            When captured as a simple string, the string shall be the
            Human Readable Form appropriate for the style of content.
            The content style can be determined from the leading
            characters of the content:</p>
            <p>UDIs beginning with:</p>
            <p>‘(‘ are in the GS1 Human Readable style;</p>
            <p>‘0-9’ are a GS1 DI (containing only the DI value, no PI
            or GS1 AI);</p>
            <p>‘+‘ are in the HIBCC Human Readable style;</p>
            <p>‘=‘ or ‘&amp;’ are in the ICCBBA Human Readable
            style.</p>
            <p>Note: If “&amp;” is used in the UDI while one of the
            delimiters in MSH.2 includes “&amp;” as well, it must be
            properly escaped per Chapter 2.7 of the HL7
            Specification.</p>
            <p>The exchange of UDI sub-elements in PRT-16 through PRT-21
            is not required when the full UDI string is provided in
            PRT.10.</p>
            <p>When a UDI is provided and sub-elements are also
            provided, then for those sub-elements that are valued, the
            content must match the content encoded in the UDI if it is
            encoded within the UDI.</p>
            <p>Caution: The UDI may contain personally identifying
            information in the form of the device serial number which
            may be used to link to other information on a patient.
            Standard practice for exchanging potentially identifying
            content should be exercised when exchanging UDIs which
            contain a serial number.</p>
            <p>Note: PRT.10 is a repeating field. Additional device
            identifiers, such as an IEEE EUI-64 may also be contained in
            this field.</p>

            Details of Device-Patient Association Query Message
            [PCD-19]</h3>
            <p>This message is used by a Device-Patient Association
            Consumer to request device-patient association information
            from a Device-Patient Association Manager, specifying
            filtering by patient identification, by location or by
            device identification. It may also be limited to a
            particular time (often the time the message is originated),
            a time interval, or it may specify an open-ended time
            interval, signifying that the Device-Patient Association
            Consumer is requesting an ongoing real-time subscription to
            device-patient association information (possibly filtered as
            just described) that is received from Device-Patient
            Association Reporters. The query takes the form of a QSB
            publish and subscribe query as described in HL7 Chapter 5,
            Section 5.7.3.1. It is almost identical to the profile for
            the QSB^Z83^QSB_Q16 trigger with ORU^R01^ORU_R01 response
            trigger described in Section 5.7.3.1 of the HL7
            specification except that the query parameters are different
            to accommodate the semantics of filtering for device-patient
            associations, and the observation reports given as the
            response to the query, while conforming to the ORU_R01
            message structure, have the specific semantics of
            transaction Device-Patient Association Reports [PCD-17].</p>
            <p>For identification, the arbitrary “local” (i.e., not
            issued by the HL7 organization) trigger event Z66 is used
            for the query/subscription message. This applies for initial
            testing but is subject to change before this profile is
            submitted for final text.</p>

            <p>Note that this segment pattern, unlike some segment
            patterns, is not introduced by any “header” type extra
            segments, but instead is a straight sequenced of repeats of
            [PCD-17] messages reporting device-patient association
            events, filtered according to the query parameters. This
            implies that it should be the same connection as the query
            was sent from the Device-Patient Association Consumer to the
            Device-Patient Association Manager, so there can be no
            confusion with other messages not from this profile. Since
            there is no end indication in the message sequence, either,
            in the case of a bolus query getting current state
            information (see the discussion under the RCP segment,
            RCP-3), the Device-Patient Association Manager will close
            the connection initiated by the Device-Patient Association
            Consumer when all the data have been sent. A new connection
            must then be connected if and when another query is
            sent.</p>

            <p>The QueryTag (QPD.2) is used to identify a query instance
            and therefore must be unique for each query.</p>
            <p>The User Parameters field (QPD.3) is used to specify
            “filtering” values, so that the query response can be
            limited to, for example, the records matching a particular
            Patient Identifier (by including a PID.3 specification), a
            particular device (by adding a Participation Device PRT
            specification) and so on. If multiple specifications are
            given, the responding system “AND”s the specifications
            together, so that for example, a patient identifier and a
            device identifier specification result in the response only
            gives associations involving that patient and device.</p>
            <p>The form of the User Parameters specifications in QPD.3
            field uses one or more repetition of the CSC data type
            (separated by the HL7 repetition separator, by default the
            tilde character ~), one for each query parameter to be
            specified, with each repetition using the QSC data type.
            This data type takes the form of a component specifying the
            field, component, or subcomponent to filter on as
            @&lt;seg&gt;.&lt;field number&gt;.&lt;component
            number&gt;.&lt;subcomponent number&gt;, followed by a
            logical operator component (normally EQ for “equals”), and a
            component giving the value sought for that field. An example
            would be:</p>
            <p>@PID.3.1.1^EQ^MR123~@PRT.10^EQ^PUMP1</p>
            <p>This means limit the messages given in response to ones
            involving patient identifier MR123 and device identifier
            PUMP1.</p>
            <p>The Device-Patient Association Manager is responsible for
            executing the search in accordance with the filters. The
            different query parameter filters are ANDed together, that
            is, only associations where all query parameters match the
            sought value will be sent by the Device-Patient Association
            Manager.</p>
            <p>Where the association records have query parameter fields
            that are repeated (as for example where multiple patient
            identifiers of different Identifier Types, or multiple
            device identifiers of different Identifier Types, are
            present), the Device-Patient Association Manager will
            consider the association record matched and send it if any
            value present in any repeat of the repeated field matches
            the sought value without regard to the Identifier Type.</p>

            Quantity Limited Request value is not used.</p>
            <p>The supported values of RCP-3 Response Modality are R
            (Real Time) or T (Bolus).</p>
            <p>In bolus mode all the available associations are sent at
            once. A Device-Patient Association Manager supporting the
            Snapshot Option must support this mode. The Device-Patient
            Association Consumer wanting a continuous real-time feed of
            association events may need to make a bolus query first to
            get all existing associations meeting the desired filter
            specification to get the starting state.</p>
            <p>In real-time mode, association records are sent as they
            arrive at the Device-Patient Association Manager. A
            Device-Patient Association Manager supporting the Snapshot
            Option must support this mode of operation, and a
            Device-Patient Association Consumer supporting the Snapshot
            option must be able to process the segment pattern.</p>
            <p>Because the segment pattern for real-time mode has no
            start or end indication, the Device-Patient Association
            Manager will signal the completion of a bolus query by
            closing the connection to the Device-Patient Association
            Consumer. The Device-Patient Association Consumer will then
            make a new connection for the real-time continuing
            query.</p>
            <p>RCP-4 Execution and Delivery Time is required when RCP-1
            contains the value of RCP-1 D (Deferred). It specifies when

            <p>RCP-5 Modify Indicator specifies whether a new
            subscription is being requested (value: N), or a
            modification is being made to an existing subscription (M).

            Cancelling a Subscription</p>
            <p>A subscription may be explicitly cancelled by the
            Device-Patient Association Consumer by sending a
            QSX^J66^QSX_J01 message, which is simply an MSH segment
            containing that string as MSH-9, followed by a QID segment

            Identification Segment containing in field QID-1 the Query
            Tag (from QPD-2 of the original query establishing the
            subscription) and in QID-2 the Message Query Name (from
            QPD-1 of the original query). See Appendix Section A.4
