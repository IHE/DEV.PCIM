# PCIM

DEV.PCIM is is the repository for all artifacts related to devlopment of the IHE DEV PCIM profile.

## Overview

The Point-of-Care Identity Management (PCIM) profile defines transactions for reporting, managing and consuming device-patient association status. Accurate device-patient association status has numerous benefits, but key to the profile is ensuring that device data being transmitted can be accurately stamped with accurate patient information. This not only increases patient safety, but also provides value to the caregiver as the alarm or other data has the patient and optional location attached to it. 

## Goals

	* Accuracy - Accurate patient and location information stamped on device data increases safety and care efficiency

	* Non-intrusive - Clinical workflow is not burdensome

	* Simplified setup and low maintenance configuration - Automation ensures systems on the network stay up to date without requiring continuous manual effort
